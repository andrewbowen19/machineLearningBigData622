The dataset I'll be using comes from the [Radiation Exposure Monitoring System (REMS) query tool](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=REMS+Qury+Tool&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) provided by the Department of Energy. It provides
```{r}
# df <- read_csv("")
```


## TODO
- Add basic cleaner script for excel file (convert to CSV locally)
- Ignore data files in .gitignore
- Add basic EDA
- Add model selection (Regression Tasks)
